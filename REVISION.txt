=============================================================================

2006-11-07 V1.0     First release, import into CVS
                    (d.k.)

2007-01-18 V1.1     MN support implemented
                    (d.k.)

2008-02-04 V1.1     Code cleanup based on PClint output
                    (d.k.)

2008-04-14 V1.1     - New driver and demo application for X86 with Realtek
                      RTL8139 network controller under Linux.
                    - several bug fixes in SDO module and NMT MN module.
                    (d.k., m.u.)

2008-04-18 V1.2     - new functions in EplApiLinuxUser interface
                    (m.u.)

2008-06-17 V1.2     - added support for RTL8139C, but refuse RTL8139C+
                    (d.k.)

2008-07-14 V1.2     - updates to EplApiLinux*.c for coming Qt demo
                    (d.k.)

2008-06-23 V1.2     - changed default node-ID to MN for RTL8139 MN demo application
                    - added SoA processing for ErrorHandler and PDO module on MN
                    - removed and fixed some TODOs and $$$
                    (d.k.)

2008-08-19 V1.2     - added Qt demo for X86 with RTL8139
                    - added handling of SDO errors on MN to demo projects.
                      These may occur if the CN drops and the SDO connection was not closed yet.
                    - added .cvsignore files to project directories
                    - added manufacturer specific EPL error codes (EPL_E_*) for
                      missing IdentResponse and StatusResponse
                    (d.k.)

2008-08-25 V1.2     - fixed bug in EplApiLinux*.c when EplApiShutdown() was called.
                      The process image thread still hung within Ioctl and therefore
                      the file release function was not called until SIGTERM.
                    (d.k.)

2008-10-01 V1.3     - SDO sequence layer: fixed error behaviour (reaction on retransmission request,
                      overrun of sequence number). tested against conformance test
                    - global.h: fixed 64-bit awarness of ARM GCC
                    (d.k.)

2008-10-02 V1.3     - updated XDD of Demo CN
                    - fixed size check when writing to OD (e.g. via SDO)
                    - made handling of some objects compliant to the spec (valid on reset, access rights)
                      (e.g. object 0x1006, 0x1F98/5)
                    (d.k.)

2008-10-06 V1.3     - added new module "PDO user part", which validates the PDO communication
                      and mapping parameters while changing them in the OD
                    - made object 0x1F8C NMT_CurrNmtState PDO-mappable (according to the spec)
                    - removed NMT MN state machine parts in Nmtu module, when MN is disabled
                    - disabled OBDu module in EplCfg.h of most projects, because EPL_OBD_USE_KERNEL
                      is used (by default in EplDef.h)
                    (d.k.)

2008-10-16 V1.3     - updated global.h with changes from CANopen
                    (d.k.)

2008-10-17 V1.3     - NMT MN module: delete timers while executing NMT reset communication
                    - DLL CN: ignore frame timeout of SoC in PreOp2, because otherwise we
                      would switch back and forth between PreOp2 and PreOp1
                    - ErrorHandlerk: added handling for LossOfPReq. Therefor object 0x1C0D was
                      added to objdict.h
                    - SDO communication layer: acknowledge NIL command on sequence layer
                    - adopt changes in objdict.h for XDD
                    - CN runs successfully through conformance test 0.9 on 2008/10/15
                    - added parentheses to all occurrences of EPL_MODULE_INTEGRATION,
                      hence using of EPL_MODULE_* defines to build it in EplCfg.h works.
                    (d.k.)

2008-11-07 V1.3     - added ARM support to global.h
                    - added Abstract Memory Interface for ARM processors (EplStack/amiarm.c)
                    (d.k.)

2008-11-13 V1.3     - fixed handling of NMT_MT6 (kEplNmtEventNmtCycleError) in NMT MN, NMTk and
                      DLLk module. The asynchronous queues are cleared now correctly, on change
                      from Op to PreOp1.
                    (d.k.)

2008-11-14 V1.3     - cf54drv for ECUcore-5484 now works on devboards with PCB 4158.4 and 4158.5
                    (d.k.)

2008-11-17 V1.3     - bug-fixes to demo-main.c of all targets:
                      * added prefix APP_ to local defines to avoid name collision with Linux for example
                      * added some objects to object dictionary for debugging purposes
                      * fixed speed selection (ignore upper bits now)
                      * global node-ID variable really reflects now the current node-ID
                      * added cyclelen parameter to kernel module
                    - added new Ethernet driver and demo project for Hilscher netX to special GPL-Addon
                    (d.k.)

2008-11-21 V1.3.1   - updated X86 Qt demo: it draws a rainbow now.
                    (d.k.)

2008-11-24 V1.3.1   - Edrv8139.c: workaround for bug in Linux kernel added (clearing driver structure
                      before calling pci_register_driver, because not all pointers inside the
                      structure are reset correctly, so some are freed twice which is very bad).
                    (d.k.)

2008-12-05 V1.3.1   - PDO module: ignore mapped object that does not exist.
                    (d.k.)

2008-12-08 V1.3.1   - EplApiLinuxKernel: using misc device instead of pure character device now,
                      because it automatically handles the sysfs entries
                    - added udev rule to X86 Qt demo
                    - updated demo_cn_kernel for ECUcore-5484 regarding the status and error LEDs
                    (d.k.)

2009-02-03 V1.3.1   - X86 Qt demo: added message box to show errors when initialization of the stack failed
                    - EplApiLinuxKernel.c: fixed hang in EplLinRelease(), when stack was not properly
                      initialized before (e.g. because of missing Ethernet controller)
                    (d.k.)

2009-02-05 V1.3.1   - added missing file EplLedu.c to public release
                    (d.k.)

2009-02-18 V1.3.1   - fixed bug in objdict.h: invalid declaration of MNCycTimeExceed cumulative
                      counter
                    - fixed project demo_cn_kernel for ECUcore-5484 + some clean-up
                    - clean-ups to project demo_mn_kernel for ECUcore-5484
                    (d.k.)

2009-03-03 V1.3.2   - ErrorHandlerk: increment cumulative counters even if threshold
                      counters are disabled
                    (d.k.)

2009-03-18 V1.3.2   - updated XDD to work with recent conformance test
                    (d.k.)

2009-03-27 V1.3.2   - EplSdoUdpu.c, ShbIpc-LinuxKernel.c: switch to kthread API, which works
                      in any 2.6 version of the Linux kernel.
                    - Edrv8139: added support for RTL8139C+ which is used in Qemu for example.
                      BTW, there is actually no difference in Tx buffer handling.
                    - added support for NMT requests (via object 0x1F9F and NMT
                      request frames)
                    - changed Makefile of MN demo for ECUcore-5484: removed dummy C files
                      that just contain includes of real C files. So this directory looks much cleaner.
                      Disadvantage: generated .o files are spawned over whole source tree.
                      There may be collisions with other projects working with the same files.
                    - changed Makefile of Qt demo project for X86: removed dummy C files that
                      just contain includes of real C files.
                    - Qt demo project for X86: added support for Basic Ethernet for state display.
                      Before this, it was handled as error state.
                    (d.k.)

2009-03-30 V1.3.2   - applied staging-epl-remove-compiler-warning-from-sharedbuff.c patch from Greg
                    - only include a file if it is needed
                    - applied staging-epl-fix-netdev-priv-b0rkage.patch from Greg:
                      netdev->priv is now gone, use netdev_priv() instead.
                    - applied staging-epl-fix-sparse-warning-in-proc_fs.c.patch from Greg:
                      proc_fs.c needs to include proc_fs.h
                    - applied staging-epl-fix-up-some-non-ansi-functions.patch from Greg:
                      () isn't valid, you need to put (void).
                    - EplApiGeneric: used wrong subindex for object 0x1F9F NMTRequest
                    (d.k.)

2009-04-06 V1.3.2   - Edrv8139: enabled promiscuous mode, so it is possible to brigde other
                      adapters like virtual machines on the epl network device
                    - SDO sequence layer: fixed reinit when connection is still alive (tested)
                    - SDO command layer: tried to fix abort handling on SDO server while segmented
                      transfer is active, but it seems not to work as expected
                    (d.k.)

2009-04-06 V1.4     - labeled V1.3.2 as V1.4
                    (d.k.)

2009-05-12 V1.5     - XDD: fixed wrong access types of some NumberOfEntries objects (should be const instead of ro);
                      changed name of object 0x1C14 to DLL_CNLossOfSocTolerance_U32;
                      fixed some default values (e.g. object 0x1f98/0x2, 0x1c0f/0x3, 0x1030/0x1)
                    - Api_CN objdict.h: changed default of object 0x1030/0x7 to 1.
                    - EplObd.c: changed EplObdGetDataSize internals to return string sizes without terminating null-character.
                      This fixes a bug in the SDO module which transmitted strings with terminating null-character.
                      But this is not allowed according to the spec.
                    (d.k.)

2009-05-22 V1.5     - made VirtualEthernetLinux.c compatible to Linux kernel V2.6.28 and higher
                      (new net_device_ops structure)
                    - synchronized global.h with the one from SYS TEC CANopen stack
                    - added some support for 64 bit processors
                    - added define for __func__ if it is missing (like MSVC)
                    (d.k.)

2009-06-05 V1.5     - added definition of hardware parameter structure for future
                      extension of init parameter structures
                    - Api_CN objdict.h: removed all #ifdef within parenthesis
                    (d.k.)

2009-06-11 V1.5     - added workaround for SdoBusy errors while configuring the cycle length
                      on the CN in X86 Qt demo
                    (d.k.)

2009-06-12 V1.5     - added tEplHwParam to init structures of API layer, DLLk and Edrv
                    (d.k.)

2009-06-15 V1.5     - fixed bug 2392067: kEplDllAsyncTxBufferFull leads to kEplShutdown in SDO ASnd layer
                    (d.k.)

2009-06-22 V1.5     - added support for object 0x1F9A NMT_HostName_VSTR in EPL API layer
                    - added object 0x1E40 NWL_IpAddrTable_0h_REC to objdict.h
                    - bug fix in XDD: same subindex was mentioned twice
                    - X86 Qt demo: added workaround for SdoBusy errors while configuring the cycle length
                    (d.k.)

2009-06-24 V1.5.1   - Highres timer on Linux: do not reject too smal time values, but increase them
                    - asynchronous send queues for StatusRequests and IdentRequests on MN:
                      made read and write index of queues volatile.
                    - DLLk module: moved timer creation to CbFrameTransmitted.
                      This prevents that the timeout elapses before the frame is actually transmitted
                      over the wire. This should solve the bug 2000711.
                    - fixed bug 2810782: prescaler of general purpose timer of
                      MCF548x was not properly calculated
                    - Windows port: It works now, except some bugs in EplTimeruWin32.c,
                      which lead to lost IdentReqs on MN.
                    (d.k.)

2009-06-25 V1.5.1   - included WinPcap 4.0.2 Developer's Pack in CVS (except docs
                      and examples)
                    - DLL: added critical section for callback functions from Edrv and highres
                      timer module. This is only necessary for platforms where Edrv and the
                      highres timer module are not able to ensure that the callback functions
                      are called mutual exclusive, e.g. Linux kernel except the Coldfire.
                    - X86 Qt demo: cleaned up the console output (e.g. NMT states),
                      removed some warnings.
                    (d.k.)

2009-06-26 V1.5.1   - OBD: renamed first part of OBD to GenericPart like in CANopen.
                    - EplObd.h: some clean-up
                    - API layer: added ObdInitRam function pointer to init parameters.
                      Now, the application with the OBD (objdict.*) can be easily separated
                      from the stack, i.e. the stack can be moved into a library.
                    - API wrapper for Linux kernel-user: added new function EplApiPostUserEvent()
                    (d.k.)

2009-07-06 V1.5.2   - removed some inexistent or unnecessary header files in Windows
                      project demo_pcap
                    (d.k.)

2009-07-09 V1.5.2   - EplDllkTgt.h: includes now linux/spinlock.h instead of asm/spinlock.h,
                      because this is the right way to do it
                    (d.k.)

2009-07-20 V1.5.2   - EplSdoUdpu.c: flush signals when receive thread finishes.
                    (d.k.)

2009-07-28 V1.5.2   - added support for Davicom DM9003 Ethernet controller connected to Atmel AT91RM9200
                      under Linux 2.6.22.
                    (d.k.)

2009-08-21 V1.5.3   - export functions of EPL API Layer if compiled as Windows DLL (bug 2841082)
                    - define the DLL export modifier if the project is compiled as DLL in
                      Visual Studio (bug 2841086)
                    (d.k.)

2009-09-02 V1.5.3   - memory leak fixed in Ethernet drivers for Pcap and RTL8139 chip, when releasing TxBuffers.
                      The real cause of this memory leak was in DLL module because it NULLified the m_pbBuffer pointer
                      in the TxBuffer structure before calling EdrvReleaseTxBuffer.
                    (d.k.)

2009-09-04 V1.5.3   - added EplTimeru implementation for use without any operating system and with Windows (EplTimeruGeneric.c).
                      Now we have a proper functioning implementation of the low-res timers for Windows with PCap driver.
                    (m.u.)

2009-09-11 V1.5.3   - fixed bug in Linux user-kernel wrapper, that prevents that TPDOs got valid
                      (race condition in EplApiLinuxKernel.c)
                    - Linux Qt demo:
                      removed obsolete reference of PdokCal module in EplApiProcessImage.c
                    (d.k.)

2009-10-01 V1.5.3   - fixed bug in Edrv8139.c
                      patch submitted by: andersblomdell, 2009-09-29 at openPOWERLINK help forum
                    - added missing string.h include for Linux user space in EplTarget.h
                    - added benchmark macros for Davicom DM9003 ethernet driver
                    (m.u.)

2009-08-03 V1.6     - EplDllk.c: only accept LossOfFrameTolerance (object 0x1C14) in non NMT reset states,
                      because all other values are only valid on reset
                    (d.k.)

2009-08-04 V1.6     - changed semantic of EplDlluCalAsyncSend(): size includes Ethernet header now.
                      The function is now compatible to EplDllkCalAsyncSend().
                      This fixes wrong size of NMT commands and requests (were 14 bytes too large).
                    (d.k.)

2009-08-05 V1.6     - moved Virtual Ethernet driver from kernel part to user part:
                      * moved initialization from DLLk module to EPL API layer
                      * implemented setting of IP address and default gateway for virtual
                        Ethernet interface.
                    - Api_CN/objdict.h: made object 0x1F8F NMT_MNNodeExpState_AU8
                      read-only according to spec
                    (d.k.)

2009-08-07 V1.6     - event queues: added error event post if sink does not exist
                    - event processing: return error if event not handled
                    - small corrections to NMT state machine to comply to spec
                    (d.k.)

2009-08-11 V1.6     - changed the DLL module for the up-coming support of Ethernet controllers with auto-response feature,
                      i.e. switched to event triggered update of IdentRes, StatusRes and PRes
                      (they are not updated right before transmission anymore, but updated
                      when their content has changed)
                      and separated configuration of PReq/PRes payload limits and timeout from
                      EplDllkAddNode().
                    (d.k.)

2009-08-12 V1.6     - timer modules: fixed pointer to unsigned long conversion and vice versa of user-specific timer argument.
                      This will be bad on 64-bit CPUs where unsigned long has only 32 bit.
                      Now it is a union.
                    - improved debug messages in demo project for EdrvPcap under Windows.
                    - switched definition of PRINTF under Windows from trace (debug output window)
                      to standard printf, if _CONSOLE is defined (i.e. console project with main function
                      instead of WinMain).
                    (d.k.)

2009-08-14 V1.6     - added Ethernet driver and demo project for openMAC with Altera Nios2 CPU as CN
                      (including the Quartus II project for the EBV DBC3C40 board).
                      The openMAC is an Ethernet controller written in VHDL with auto-response feature
                    (d.k.)

2009-09-01 V1.6     - add "Ms" to Timeout variables in SharedBuffer and ShbIpc* implementation to
                      clearly state the unit.
                    - fixed ShbIpc-LinuxKernel implementation: job-ready timeout is now treated in unit of 1 ms.
                    (d.k.)

2009-09-02 V1.6     - Eventk.c and SharedBuff implementation: fixed case of enum constant kShbPriorityHigh

                    - Added target specific functions for ShbIpc-NoOS.c for the Altera Nios2 CPU
                    (m.u.)

2009-09-02 V1.6     - New feature: implemented support in DLL for Ethernet drivers/controllers with auto-response
                      feature. There is a new function EdrvChangeFilter, which must be implemented by each Ethernet driver.
                    (d.k.)

2009-09-08 V1.6     - optimized PDO processing. It is several times faster that the old version.
                      All projects need the new module EplPdouCal.c and the module EplPdou.c now.
                      This implies adding EPL_MODULE_PDOU to the definition of EPL_MODULE_INTEGRATION in EplCfg.h.
                    (d.k.)

2009-09-14 V1.6     - fixed bug in boot step 1 of MN, where IdentRequest was issued twice (once by NMT Reset Node Sent event
                      and once by EplNmtMnuStartBootStep1)
                    (d.k.)

2009-09-15 V1.6     - implemented PRes filtering in DLL and PDOk module.
                    (d.k.)

2009-09-16 V1.6     - renamed EPL_NO_FIFO to EPL_USE_SHAREDBUFF
                    - LED module: inserted init state for status LED to force the status LED to off on NMT state initialization
                    - implemented new macro EPL_EVENT_USE_KERNEL_QUEUE for disabling
                      the kernel part event queue and directly processing kernel part events within interrupt lock
                    - cleaned-up default object dictionary: replaced magic constants
                      of object type and access rights with corresponding enum constants
                    (d.k.)

2009-09-16 V1.6     - implemented TimerHighResk for openMAC (compare unit)
                    (m.u.)

2009-09-17 V1.6     - code clean-up: removed unnecessary code and comments, restructured some functions
                    (d.k.)

2009-09-18 V1.6     - set default vendor-ID in public objdict.h files to 0x00
                    - changed Makefile of all Linux projects: removed dummy C files
                      that just contain includes of real C files. So these project directories look
                      much cleaner now.
                    - changed Makefile of all Linux projects to remove unnecessary EplObdu.c,
                      EplObduCal.c and EplObdkCal.c. Only EplObd.c is necessary.
                    - added EplPdouCal.c and EplPdou.c to Makefile of all demo projects
                    - added constant EPL_MODULE_PDOU to the definition of EPL_MODULE_INTEGRATION
                      in EplCfg.h of all demo projects
                    (d.k.)

2009-09-18 V1.6     - added new demo project "demo_cn_3r1tpdo" which maps 50 byte to 3 RPDOs and 50 byte 1 TPDO
                    - added new OD "CiA401_3r1tpdo_CN" and moved address ranges 1000h-13FFh and 1B00h-1FFFh to a generic section
                    (m.u.)

2009-09-21 V1.6     - performance improvements of FPGA design for openMAC demo on EBV DBC3C40 board:
                      * increased CPU clock to 90 MHz (one additional Read waitstate needs to be added to SRAM interface)
                      * increased I-Cache to 16 kB
                      * decreased size of onchip mem to 1 kB
                    (d.k., m.u.)

2009-09-22 V1.6     - bug fixed in DLL module on MN: delete timer for PRes timeout monitoring, before
                      next PReq will be sent.
                    (d.k.)

2009-09-24 V1.6     - implemented macro for DLL configuration to select when to call the sync process function
                      (e.g. on SoC, on SoA or via special timer sync module).
                    - removed NetTime from tEdrvRxBuffer and tEplFrameInfo.
                    - inserted target specific tEplTgtTimeStamp into tEdrvRxBuffer, which will be
                      used by special timer sync module.
                    - implemented timer sync module for openMAC, which triggers the sync process function
                      a configurable time before the SoC.
                    (d.k., m.u.)

                      * fixed compiler errors
                      * removed call to function EplPdokCalSetTpdosValid from EplApiProcessImage.c
                        as this work around is no longer necessary
                      * integrated the user mode Qt4 application into the Makefile for the kernel module
                    (m.u.)

2009-09-29 V1.6     - revised main readme.txt
                    - added update.txt for description of necessary changes to your application project

                    (m.u.)

2009-12-04 V1.6     - CN demo for EBV DBC3C40 board: configured RPDO to use PReq instead of PResMN,
                      because this is the usual case for the POWERLINK demo network
                    (d.k.)

2009-12-18 V1.6     - EplObd.c: writing to Domains where no variable is linked (NULL pointer) is allowed
                      if OD callback function allocates memory.
                    - removed unnecessary EplObdu.c and similar files from Windows PCap demo project
                    - fixed warnings from MSVC8 in SharedBuff.c and ShbIpc-Win32.c
                    - replaced macro EPL_MODULE_CFGMA by EPL_MODULE_CFM, because CFM is the official
                      abbreviation for Configuration Manager
                    - added the Configuration Manager module CFM (originally developed by Kalycito)
                    - EPL API layer: added new event kEplApiEventCfmProgress to inform the application
                      about the progress of the CDC download process of the CFM
                    - added CFM demo application for Windows (originally developed by Kalycito)

                    - fixed bug in SDO command layer: added missing break in case. This bug caused a transfer
                      start inside the SDO callback function after a lower layer abort to fail.
                      Now it starts the reconnection as intended.
                    - fixed compiler warning "conditional expression is constant" by replacing while(1) with for(;;)
                    - fixed signed/unsigned conflicts
                    - added missing local variable initializations
                    - SharedBuff IPC for Windows: fixed compiler warning "standard incompliant L-value expression"

                    - added support for DOMAIN arrays to the object dictionary module. This is especially
                      necessary for object 0x1F22 of the CFM.
                      (the DOMAIN arrays are instanciated by macro EPL_OBD_RAM_INDEX_RAM_VARARRAY_NOINIT in objdict.h)
                    (d.k.)

2010-01-08 V1.6     - added EplObdCdc.c (module for local CDC file import)

                    - Api_CN object dictionary: use the generic object dictionary parts from now on.
                      This eases the maintainability.
                    - removed dependency of NMT user part module on kernel part module.
                      NMT CAL is not necessary anymore.
                    - EplNmtMnuTriggerStateChange posts an event now. This makes this function
                      thread-safe.
                    (d.k.)

2010-01-12 V1.6     - cleaned up ioctl commands for Linux kernel userspace wrapper.
                      They use now the proper _IO macros.
                    - added wrapper for POSIX file API under Linux kernel
                    - added demo project for CFM under Linux kernel (with RTL8139 network card)
                    (d.k.)

2010-01-14 V1.6     - added check to EPL API layer if SDO channel is used by CFM before performing a SDO transfer for the application.
                      This gives the CFM a higher priority for SDO transfers than the application
                    - EplObdCdc.c: added debug messages to local CDC import
                    - added XDD file for MN object dictionary
                    (d.k.)

                      strict-aliasing rules" in EplObdMacro.h
                    - OBD module: declared default values in OBD as const
                    - Object dictionary: added new macro for PDO mapping parameters:
                      EPL_OBD_RAM_INDEX_RAM_PDO_MAPPING
                    (d.k.)

2010-03-01 V1.7     - PosixFileLinuxKernel.c: added include for linux/sched.h,
                      because some kernel versions need this
                    (d.k.)

                      In contrast to the previous behaviour, the rx-filter stays enabled.
                    (m.u.)

2010-04-01 V1.7     - generic objdict_*.h: fixed wrong sub-index count of object 0x1F8A
                    (d.k.)

2010-04-06 V1.7     - EplTarget.h: Add defines for EPL_MEMCPY, MEMSET and MEMCMP if not defined for the current target
                    - EplDllk: Use puiHandle_p in EplDllkCreateTxFrame for acceleration of PReq frame search

                      * Add default macro definitions for EPL_MALLOC and EPL_FREE without type casts
                        The specific macro definitions have been removed from target _NO_OS_.
                      * Remove ';' after memcpy and memset macro definitions
                        This has already been introduced for memcmp and allows usage of the
                        macros in a more flexible way.
                    (m.u.)

2010-04-14 V1.7     - demo projects for Altera FPGA: added support for node-ID hex switch
                    (d.k.)

2010-04-27 V1.7     - SDO command layer:
                      * fixed bugs in SDO server (wrong segment size on ReadByIndex on segmented transfer
                        and wrong segmented transfer on WriteByIndex)
                      * and on SDO client side (wrongly calculated number of transferred bytes)

                      because the data didn't arrive at openMAC on time.
                    - use navigation keys on EBV DBC3C40 devboard as node-ID switch.
                    - demo projects for NiosII: additionally support node-ID switch as PIO device
                    (d.k.)

2010-08-12 V1.7     - EplApiLinuxKernel.c: use unlocked_ioctl instead of plain ioctl if available.
                      This might solve some timing problems with Linux user-space, because
                      the big kernel lock (BKL) isn't aquired anymore. The BKL is not needed anyway.
                    (d.k.)
